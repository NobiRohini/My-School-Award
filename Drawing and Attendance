🌟 Throwback to a Proud School Achievement 🌟

My name is Rohini Gupta Pandiri, and today I wanted to share one of the most beautiful and proud moments from my school days that still brings a smile to my face.

During my time in 8th class at Ravindra Bharathi Public School, Satyanarayanapuram, Vijayawada, I had the honor of receiving a medal and a prize for my performance in Drawing and for maintaining Excellent Attendance throughout the academic year.

🏅 This wasn't just any achievement—it was a moment that reflected my dedication, creativity, discipline, and the continuous encouragement I received from those around me.

What made this event even more special was that the prize distribution happened on stage, in front of my fellow classmates and teachers. I was blessed to receive the award from my Vice Principal, Deepa Mam, and HOD Sir, Ramu Sir—two individuals who always inspired me to do my best.

✨ The highlight of this celebration was having my parents join me on stage, standing proudly beside me as I received my medal and prize. It was a moment of immense happiness, gratitude, and motivation.

📚 Lesson Learned: Celebrate your wins—no matter how big or small. Each one adds up to the story you’re writing for your future.

💫 Quote that inspired me then (and still does):
"Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out."

With love and nostalgia,
Rohini Gupta Pandiri
